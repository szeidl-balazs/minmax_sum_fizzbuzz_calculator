# hECMAthlon

## Story

The `hECMAthlon` is a feature competition where programmers can mesure their strenght in refactoring javascript code.
Every competitor gets a codebase and their task is to refactor the code using the newest features of the ECMAScript.
You are lucky and your friend is part of the judge of the competition.
He shared with you the codebase and the main point of view of the judgement.
Before you participate in the real competition you need to practise on it. 

## What are you going to learn?

- Advanced Javascript
- Refactor code

## Tasks

1. Transform the variables in every function to being declared with the `const` or `let` keywords.
    - There is no variable declared with the `var` keyword in the javascript code

2. Transform the `hecmathlon` object to a class. Restructure the `log.js` file to work with the `hecmathlon` class.
    - The `hecmathlon` declared as a class

3. The `reduce()` method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in single output value. Refactor the `getMaxValue()` function using the `reduce()` method.
    - The `getMaxValue()` function starts with the `return` keyword in the javascript code

4. The `filter()` method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. Refactor the `getGreterThan()` function using the `filter()` method.
    - The `getGreterThan()` function starts with the `return` keyword in the javascript code

5. The `map()` method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. Refactor the `fizzBuzz()` function using the `map()` method.
    - There is no `for` loop in the `fizzBuzz()` function in the javascript code

6. Refactor the `getOutput()` function in the `log.js` file using the spread operator.
    - The `getOutput()`functions starts with the `return` keyword in the `log.js` file

## General requirements

- Every functionality works after the refactoring
- All the functions are declared as arrow functions

## Hints

- There are more features about the features following the ES6. We can't cover all of them so take your time and browse amongst them.
- Try out the functionalities of the code before and after the refactor. It's easier to find out where you ruined the code if you do
